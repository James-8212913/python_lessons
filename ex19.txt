Welcome to IPython!
Your favorite libraries have been loaded.
We can give the function numbers directly
You have 20 cheeses!
You have 30 boxes of crackers
Man, that's enough for a party.
Get a blanket. 

Or, we can use variables from our script
You have 10 cheeses!
You have 50 boxes of crackers
Man, that's enough for a party.
Get a blanket. 

We can do math inside a funciton too.
You have 30 cheeses!
You have 11 boxes of crackers
Man, that's enough for a party.
Get a blanket. 

And we can combine the two, math and variables.
You have 110 cheeses!
You have 150 boxes of crackers
Man, that's enough for a party.
Get a blanket.
