# Learn Python the Hard Way - Lessons

This is a repo of lessons taken from the book <https://www.amazon.com.au/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914>. There a plenty of free copies of this material online, I'm sure you can find one if you really want to but by purchasing it you enable good people to continue to deliver this kind of reference for future generations.

The lessons are incomplete and I am still working through them with peers. Needless to say its a journey and finishing isn't the end state when learning...

Feel free to make corrections and offer any insights or better ways to do things - we are all trying to learn.
